# calorie-consumption

It is an application designed to track calories consumed and burned. This project uses `useReducer` to efficiently manage application state.

When you open the app, you'll be able to choose between two main categories: "Food" and "Exercise." Simply select the category that corresponds to your current activity.

Once the category is selected, enter the name of the activity and then record the calories consumed or burned. This allows detailed monitoring of your calorie balance.
